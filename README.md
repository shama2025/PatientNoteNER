# PatientNoteNER
PatientNoteER is my first Health Informatics project, with the goal of categorizing doctor's note's about patients into specific labels. Although this project is a proof of concept, due to lack of compute units, it goes to show the potential of an AI assistant to help those in the medical field with notes regarding patients.
